# Chirp tac toe
Play a tic tac toe game with others without requiring any network connection

## How to play?
- First, identify yourself by a nickname to play with an ID
- Second, wait that your friend send to you his ID
- Start the turn by turn game (this first player is random)
- The first player to get 3 points in a row, a column or a diagonal is the winner.

## What does it use?
  - Flutter
  - Chirp SDK

## Why this project ?
When I heard about the sound way to exchange data between nearby devices, I was really interested to make a PoC about it.
Then, I wanted to innovate the way to play in aircraft mode, anywhere. So, finally, I thought about making this basic game.

## To do
- [X] Android, iOS, Fuchsia
- [X] gameplay
- [X] multiplayer
- [X] security I (each player has an ID and can only play with one other player ID)
- [ ] Let players choose frequency of sound (ultrasonic, 16kHz, Standard)
- [ ] Nice design
- [ ] Desktop app
- [ ] security II (acknowledgement of receipt ?)
